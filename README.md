# Further Details

My implementations that were physically seen were:
- Defense Potion 
- Legendary Rake

My implementations in the background:
- Weapon Effect
- Loot Pickup radius for Defense 
- Updating Stats

There were more pieces in the background than physically seen in the game.  During my time watching the tutorials I spent most of my time in the background coding different ways that variables can be adjusted.  

I didn't spend any time on the UI part of the game which is why none of the variables I messed with were seen on the game.  

All-In-All I enjoyed making this and it also helped me have a better understanding of how my coding classes work.  Plus it is VERY helpful that I am coming into this class with knowledge of Java.  Switching from Java to C# is very similar.
